              <h2>Psycho Pass</h2>
              <p>
                Psycho-Pass is set in a futuristic Japan governed by the Sibyl System (ã‚·ãƒ“ãƒ¥ãƒ©ã‚·ã‚¹ãƒ†ãƒ , Shibyura Shisutemu), a powerful biomechatronic computer network which endlessly measures the biometrics of Japanese citizens' brains and mentalities using a "cymatic scan." The resulting assessment is called a Psycho-Pass (ã‚µã‚¤ã‚³ãƒ‘ã‚¹, Saikopasu), which includes a numeric Crime Coefficient (çŠ¯ç½ªä¿‚æ•°, HanzaikeisÅ«) index, revealing the citizen's criminality potential, and a color-coded Hue, alerting law enforcement to other data, as well as the improvement (clearing) or decline (clouding) of said Psycho-Pass. When a targeted individual's Crime Coefficient index exceeds the accepted threshold (100), they are pursued, apprehended, and either arrested or killed by the field officers of the Crime Investigation Department of the Ministry of Welfare's Public Safety Bureau. Elite officers known as Inspectors research and evaluate crime scenes, including all personnel involved, with the assistance of Enforcers. Enforcers are latent criminals charged with protecting the Inspectors, adding their expertise and carrying out Inspectors' instructions. Both are equipped with personally activated hand-held weapons called "Dominators" whose integrated scanners provide the target's immediate Psycho-Pass. The gun-like weapon can only fire when approved by the Sibyl System and triggered by its owner. Inspectors and Enforcers work as a team, though Inspectors have jurisdiction to fire their Dominators on the Enforcers should they pose a danger to the public or the Inspectors themselves.

              <p>
                After numerous experiments with creating autonomous AI, humans concluded that AI could only be functional if they were given just a single mission to dedicate their lives to. With that in mind, the first autonomous AI, a songstress named Diva, was created with a mission to "make people happy with [her] songs". However, Diva's quest to sing on the main stage of the theme park NiaLand is disrupted by the arrival of Matsumoto, an AI from 100 years in the future who tells her of a world where AI have decided to eradicate humanity, and wishes to join hands with her to prevent it.
